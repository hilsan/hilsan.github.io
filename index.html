I am a computational chemist specializing in atmospheric chemistry and astrochemistry. I obtained my graduate degree from Chalmers University of Technology in computational chemistry applied to the (astro-) chemistry of hydrogen cyanide and its polymers. Since two years, I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/hilda-sandstr%C3%B6m">Aalto university</a> and the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vilma">Virtual laboratory for molecular level atmospheric transformations (VILMA) center of excellence</a>.
