This month marks the start of a 2-year position for me at TUM! Here I will conduct my MSCA funded project "Cloudmap". More updates will come but for now you can read more about the project at [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101203938) and enjoy an autumnal picture of my dog Asta, who will accompany me on this new adventure!
