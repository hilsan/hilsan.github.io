I am thrilled to announce that I have been awarded a **Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowship (**â‚¬202,125.12**)! ðŸŒŸ

The project, named **CLOUDMAP**, was funded by the **European Commission under Horizon Europe**. will run for **24 months** and will focus on **data-driven methods for the identification of atmospheric compounds**. This fellowship will allow me to combine machine learning and atmospheric chemistry to advance our understanding of complex molecular systems in the atmosphere. The work will be conducted under the supervision of Prof. Patrick Rinke at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
