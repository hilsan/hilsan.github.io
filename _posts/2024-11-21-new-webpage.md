The personal webpage project is officially live! Here, I am hoping to collect a mixture of info about me, my research and related activities. Hopefully potential collaborators, employers and the general public alike will find it useful! The ambition is also to start blogging at some point about developments in my area of research (computational chemistry/compound identification/particle formation/HCN polymerization).
