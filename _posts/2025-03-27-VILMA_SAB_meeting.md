Just returned from a 2-day trip to Helsinki. The [VILMA Centre of Excellence](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vilma) gathered for a morning of presentations from our principal investigators. In the afternoon, we had an internal poster session. The event was attended by our scientific advisory board, who evaluated the centre's progress. 

On the second day, PhD student Lucas Bandeira presented his midterm seminar on his work developing machine learning interatomic potentials for atmospheric organic compounds. It was a well-carried out presentation, and the discussion was led by opponent Bernhard Rieschl from the University of Helsinki. Very happy to be the acting advisor!
