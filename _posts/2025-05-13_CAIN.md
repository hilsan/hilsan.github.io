A few months after joining **Climate AI Nordics** as a core member, we finally held the inaugural workshop. The event brought together researchers working on AI applications across climate and sustainability topics, from molecular-scale studies to large climate models and biodiversity.  

I was honored when Olof and Aleksei, the main organizers, invited me to give a talk on my research. I focused on making chemistry topics accessible to a broad audience, and judging by the response, the message came through—though I admit there were some nerves on my part!  

The workshop concluded with a core group meeting, and it was fantastic to meet everyone in person for the first time. Plans are already underway for next year’s event in **Copenhagen in June 2026**, where I hope to bring a larger audience from Finland and the chemistry community.
