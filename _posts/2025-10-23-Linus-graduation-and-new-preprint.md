This past month marked the graduation of master student **Linus Lind**, who joined the group at Aalto in 2023 as a bachelor student and continued as a research assistant to complete his master thesis.  

During his time with the group, Linus worked on developing a new molecular descriptor for atmospheric compounds. Just weeks after his graduation, his work has been published as a preprint: [arXiv:2510.20465](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.20465).  

It has been so much fun as a supervisor to follow Linus through his studies and theses, and we hope to collaborate more in the future!
