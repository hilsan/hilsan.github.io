I just concluded my first ever participation of the [EGU General Assembly 2025](https://www.egu25.eu/) in Vienna, Austria. I had heard previous rumors about its massive size, and was happy to find full of interesting parallell tracks to follow, also from a data-science/molecular sciences point of view!  

I presented my recent progress with a poster on data-driven identification of atmospheric compounds and met researchers who were interested in applying such methods to their data. So success!
