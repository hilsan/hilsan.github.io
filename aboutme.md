Postdoctoral researcher at [Aalto university][Aalto link]

My name is Hilda Sandstr√∂m and welcome to my homepage!

I am a computational chemist by trade, and I specialize in atmospheric chemsitry and astrochemistry. 

I obtained my graduate degree from Chalmers University of Technology in computational chemistry applied to the (astro-) chemistry of hydrogen cyanide and its polymers. Since two years, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Aalto university][Aalto link] and the [Virtual laboratory for molecular level atmospheric transformations (VILMA) center of excellence][VILMA link].
